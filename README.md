# Drowsiness-Detection


The objective of the project was to create a drowsiness detection model using the YOLO algorithm.

The following processes were followed to achieve the desired result:
1. Instal Ultralytics YOLOv5 
2. Detect Objects from Images 
3. Detect Objects from Pre-Recorded Videos 
4. Detect Objects in Real Time Using OpenCV 
5. Fine Tuning a Drowsiness Model using YOLOv5 and PyTorch 
6. Perform Real Time Drowsiness Detection 

## Result

## Inference
The YOLO algorithm is being used in TESLA cars for object tracking and making sure the possibilities of accidents are reduced by predicting the path of objects using several cameras installed in and around a TESLA car. 
While preparing the data I had to take many features of myself in a sleepy state. While creating the data, I realized that when we’re asleep, we’re all the same and what makes us stand out is our ability to think. 
Clinically speaking, everyone has the same physical features. What makes them stand out is their ability to think. A good cohesion of mentality and ability goes well in pursuing your goals and dreams.
The use case of this model is to prevent drivers on long journeys from falling asleep and making sure they take a well-earned rest.
